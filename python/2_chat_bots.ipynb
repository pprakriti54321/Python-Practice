        "In the OpenAI Language Model (LLM) API, the roles of \"system,\" \"assistant,\" and \"user\" are used to define the flow of a conversation and the context in which the AI operates. Here's a description of each role:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. System:\n",
        "- **Role:** The \"system\" role is used to set the behavior and instructions for the AI. It defines how the assistant should behave during the conversation.\n",
        "- **Purpose:** The system message typically provides the AI with guidelines, such as the tone, style, or specific instructions on how to interact with the user. For example, it might instruct the assistant to be concise, to use formal language, or to act as a specific character.\n",
        "- **Example:** \"You are a helpful assistant that provides concise and accurate answers.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Assistant:\n",
        "- **Role:** The \"assistant\" role represents the AI's responses in the conversation.\n",
        "- **Purpose:** The assistant generates responses based on the context provided by the system and user messages. This role is used to deliver the AI's output to the user.\n",
        "- **Example:** If a user asks, \"What is the capital of France?\" the assistant might respond, \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. User:\n",
        "- **Role:** The \"user\" role represents the input from the human interacting with the AI.\n",
        "- **Purpose:** The user provides questions, commands, or other forms of input that the assistant needs to respond to. The user's messages drive the conversation, guiding what the assistant says next.\n",
        "- **Example:** A user might say, \"Tell me a joke,\" to which the assistant would respond with a joke.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Conversation Flow:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **System:** \"You are a friendly and informative assistant.\"\n",
        "- **User:** \"What's the weather like today?\"\n",
        "- **Assistant:** \"I’m sorry, but I cannot check the weather right now. However, I can help you with any other questions you might have.\"\n",
        "\n",
